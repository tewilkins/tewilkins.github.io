# Hello!

My name is Thomas Wilkins.
I am a PhD student at the University of Melbourne (UoM), joining as a member of the Waterway Ecosystem Research Group (WERG) in the School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences (SEFS).

# My project

My PhD project looks at improving river ecosystem management and understanding, by using DNA barcoding tools to identify species and model species' relationships with their environments.
