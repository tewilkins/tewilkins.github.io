<p>A week ago I went to dinner with a group of friends.
The next day the person sat opposite me informed me they had tested positive for COVID-19, including a photo of their Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) cassette<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
A few days later I developed a dry throat, fatigue, and brain fog, but also some very concerning some flu-like symptoms… similar to my friend who had just tested positive… oh no!
Naturally I went overboard on the RATs and performed a test every day for five days.
To my relief, all five were negative and I concluded it was just a nasty cold.</p>
<p>Was I really going overboard though?
RAT tests are currently the primary means for identifying positive cases of COVID-19 in Victoria.
In the last 24 hours before the time of writing this post, <a href="https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/victorian-coronavirus-covid-19-data">3085 cases were identified via PCR testing and 9069 probable cases via RATs</a>.
That means 3/4 positive cases were identified using RATs.</p>
<p>However, that gives us no information on why anyone would take five RAT tests.
What kind of maniac would do such a thing?
And who are we (i.e., you) to judge?
Well, as it turns out, we can use Bayes’ Theorem to work out exactly how much of a maniac that person (i.e., I) might be!
Clearly I’m worried about the false-negative rate, and</p>
<div id="bayes-theorem" class="section level2">
<h2>Bayes’ Theorem</h2>
<p>Bayes’ Theorem describes the probability that an event should occur, given that a condition has (or hasn’t) been met.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(A|B) = \frac{Pr(B|A)Pr(A)}{Pr(B)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(B)\)</span> is found with the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Pr(B) = Pr(B|A)Pr(A) + Pr(D|\bar{A})Pr(\bar{A})\)</span></p>
<p>It applies well to medical screening and defective item testing - the two things I want to know more about.
There’s a few things that were found in Leiner et al. (2021): The specificity (i.e., the True-Positive rate) was 62.3%, and the specificity (i.e., the True-Negative) was 97.6%.
If we plug these numbers into the formula above, we get the probability that a person is infected with COVID-19 after testing positive on a RAT: </p>

<p>So, the posterior probability that I have contracted COVID-19 after having tested positive is only 21.18%.
That’s… extremely shocking.
This suggests RAT tests are incorrect about 4 out of 5 times!
So if I perform 5 RATs, I should expect exactly one of them to have a true positive result, yes?
And that means my method is not stupid and I’m not a maniac, YES??
</p>
<p>Sadly, no.</p>
